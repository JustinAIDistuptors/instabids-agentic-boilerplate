### Common Issues to Check

#### Wrong Import Pattern
```python
# ‚ùå Wrong
import google.generativeai as genai

# ‚úÖ Correct
from google import genai
```

#### Missing Tool Context
```python
# ‚ùå Wrong
def my_tool(data: dict) -> dict:
    pass

# ‚úÖ Correct
def my_tool(tool_context: ToolContext, data: dict) -> dict:
    pass
```

#### Improper State Management
```python
# ‚ùå Wrong
context.state["project_id"] = "123"

# ‚úÖ Correct
context.state["user:project_id"] = "123"
```

#### Poor Error Handling
```python
# ‚ùå Wrong
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except:
    return {"error": "Failed"}

# ‚úÖ Correct
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificError as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
    return {
        "status": "error",
        "message": f"Failed to complete operation: {str(e)}",
        "error_code": "OPERATION_FAILED"
    }
```

#### Missing Validation
```python
# ‚ùå Wrong
def save_project(tool_context, title, budget):
    # Direct use without validation
    
# ‚úÖ Correct
def save_project(tool_context, title: str, budget: float):
    if not title or len(title) < 3:
        return {"status": "error", "message": "Title too short"}
    
    if budget < 0:
        return {"status": "error", "message": "Invalid budget"}
```

### Review Priorities

1. **Security vulnerabilities** - Fix immediately
2. **Data corruption risks** - Fix before deployment
3. **Performance bottlenecks** - Fix if impacting users
4. **Code maintainability** - Fix in next iteration
5. **Style issues** - Fix when touching the code

### Automated Checks

Run these before manual review:
```bash
# Linting
poetry run ruff check .

# Type checking
poetry run mypy .

# Security scan
poetry run bandit -r src/

# Test coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=instabids
```

### Feedback Guidelines

1. **Be specific**: Point to exact lines and files
2. **Be constructive**: Suggest improvements, not just problems
3. **Be educational**: Explain why something is an issue
4. **Be practical**: Consider development constraints
5. **Be positive**: Acknowledge good practices

### Sample Review Comments

**For Good Code**:
> "Excellent error handling here. The specific exception types and detailed messages will help with debugging."

**For Issues**:
> "This tool is missing the required `tool_context` parameter. Add it as the first parameter to comply with ADK standards. See docs/ADK_BEST_PRACTICES.md for details."

**For Improvements**:
> "Consider extracting this logic into a separate function for better testability and reuse. This would also make the main function more readable."

### Post-Review Actions

1. Create GitHub issues for major problems
2. Update tests to prevent regression
3. Document patterns in team wiki
4. Share learnings with team
